## Building locally

Clone and build the front-end
```
$ git clone https://github.com/plotly/dash-auth.git
$ cd dash-auth/js
$ yarn
$ yarn run build
```

Install the python package
```
$ cd dash-auth
$ python setup.py install
```

## Publishing

This package is available on PyPI. We can create a new version as often as whenever a PR is merged.

To publish:
1. **PyPI Access**
- Ask @chriddyp to be added as a maintainer on PyPI.
Note that for security reasons, this is restricted to Plotly employees.
- PyPI has a new website, register your account here: https://pypi.org/.
- If you already have a PyPI account, you'll need to make sure that your email is registered
- Add your PyPI credentials to a file at `~/.pypirc`. 
It will look something like:
```
[distutils]
index-servers =
   pypi
[pypi]
username:your_pypi_username
password:your_pypi_password
```

2. **Changelogs and Version**
- Check the recent commits and PRs and add anything notable to the `CHANGELOG.md` file
- Bump the version number in `version.py`. Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)
- Create a PR and tag @chriddyp for review
- Once reviewed, merge into master.

3. **Build Front-End**
The front-end JavaScript code is bundled as part of this package. 
So, you'll need to build the JS bundle:
```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull origin master
$ cd dash-auth/js
$ yarn
$ yarn run build
```

4. **Create a Python Build**
```
$ python setup.py sdist
```

5. **Upload the Build to PyPI**
First, install twine: the new tool for uploading packages to PyPI
```
$ pip install twine
```

Then, upload to PyPI using Twine.
```
$ twine upload dist/dash_auth-VERSION.tar.gz
```
Where `VERSION` refers to the version number of package. This file was created in Step 4.

6. **Test it out**
In a new folder, make sure the installation uploaded correctly. 
Note that sometimes PyPI's servers take a few minutes for installations to be recognized.
```
pip install dash-auth --upgrade
```

7. **Update the version number in `dopsa`**
We fix the version number in [`dash-on-premise-sample-app`](https://github.com/plotly/dash-on-premise-sample-app/).

Create a PR to update that version in https://github.com/plotly/dash-on-premise-sample-app/blob/master/requirements.txt.
