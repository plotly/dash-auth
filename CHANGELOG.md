## [2.2.0] - 2024-02-05
### Added
- Possibility to whitelist routes with the `add_public_routes` utility function, the routes should follow Flask route syntax
- NOTE: If you are using server-side callbacks on your public routes, you should use dash_auth's new `public_callback` rather than the default Dash callback

## [2.1.0] - 2024-01-24
### Changed
- Uses flask `before_request` to protect all endpoints rather than protecting routes present at instantiation time
- Allows user to use user-defined authorization python function instead of a dictionary/list of usernames and passwords
- Raise minimum Python version to 3.8, dropping support for 3.6 and 3.7

## [2.0.0] - 2023-03-10
### Removed
Removed obsolete `PlotlyAuth`. `dash-auth` is now just responsible for `BasicAuth`.
Drop Python 2 support. Minimum Python version is now 3.6.

## [1.4.1] - 2019-10-04
### Fixed
Fixed a bug with PlotlyAuth not properly converting user data to json

## [1.4.0] - 2019-09-02
### Changed
Updated to require dash 1.x - this did not affect the API of this package at all, but usage examples and tests were adapted for the dash API changes.

## [1.3.2] - 2018-12-18
### Change
Changed basic-auth to use a dictionary of valid credentials, rather than lists.
This ensures only one valid password per user, and credential checks are faster.

## [1.3.1] - 2018-12-05
### Changed
Changed the deprecation notice to only 2 repos (`dash-basic-auth` and `dash-enterprise-auth`).
The oauth abstraction can still be used with dash-auth.

## [1.3.0] - 2018-12-04

Add integrations with Dash Deployment Server 2.6. [#75](https://github.com/plotly/dash-auth/pull/75)
This version works on both 2.5 and 2.6.

dash-auth will be split into 2 repositories:

- `dash-basic-auth` -> basic_auth
- `dash-enterprise-auth` -> Dash Deployment Server integration, replace PlotlyAuth.

### Added
- Pending deprecation notice for PlotlyAuth.

### Changed
- Logout button changed to a `dcc.LogoutButton` if app is on Dash Deployment Server 2.6
- `get_username` from request headers if app is on Dash Deployment Server 2.6
- Disabled authentication if app is on Dash Deployment Server>=2.6, authentication is now performed on the Dash Deployment Server for all deployed apps.

### Fixed
- Fixed logout invalidation url and put in a try/catch so the token is still cleared from the cookies after an error.

## [1.2.0] - 2018-10-11
### Fixed
- Kerberos tickets can be retrieved from a Dash Deployment Server and used
to perform multi-hop authentication. [#64](https://github.com/plotly/dash-auth/pull/64)

### Fixed

## [1.1.2] - 2018-08-15
### Fixed
- Remove trailing slash from the cookie path.

## [1.1.1] - 2018-08-14

## [1.0.2] - 2018-05-31
### Fixed
- Use update_or_create for OAuth app creation when available, to avoid
  race condition.

## [1.0.1] - 2018-05-02
### Fixed
- Handle the case where more than one OAuth app exists in streambed.

## [1.0.0] - 2018-04-11
### Added
- `PlotlyAuth` now supports "secret" authentication using the `share_key`
parameter.

### Changed
- All `Auth` subclasses must now implement `index_auth_wrapper()`. See
`basic_auth.py` for an example that preserves the existing behaviour.

## [0.1.0] - 2018-03-27
### Added
- `PlotlyAuth` now supports multiple URLs. Supply a localhost URL and a remote
URL in order to test your Plotly login on your local machine while keeping
the login screen available in your deployed app. Usage:
```
dash_auth.PlotlyAuth(app, 'my-app', 'private', [
    'https://my-deployed-dash-app.com',
    'http://localhost:8050'
])
```
See https://github.com/plotly/dash-auth/pull/29

used in Dash Apps that are deployed with multiple workers.
See https://github.com/plotly/dash-auth/pull/32

## [0.0.8] - 2017-09-26
